# Discord Recipe Bot
My discord recipe bot implements Spoonacular (Recipe Data) API along with Discord's bot api/functionality to create a working recipe bot that can be added to any server. This bot is primarily made in Python 3.9, but also implements some basic html for structing the recipe object. 
I currently have a version of this bot running on Raspberry PI so that you can add my version of the bot to any server. However, as this bot was constructed with the primary purpose of my own learning I have kept the invitation link private, please message me for access.


# Requirements / Instructions
You will need a discord and spoonacular api key, both of which are free (upto 150 recipe requests per day).

1. Add your api keys to the str variables inside of the config file.
2. Run the runner file.
3. Message the bot through direct message or on any server channel they're in. (If wanted you can restrict this bot to only respond in certain channels.)
4. Optional: You can type !help in discord chat to see a list of commands.
